# Gradle Wrapper JAR File

This file should contain the gradle-wrapper.jar binary.

For actual building, you need to:

1. Clone the repository locally
2. Run: `gradle wrapper` to generate the gradle-wrapper.jar
3. Or download from: https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-8.2-bin.zip

The GitHub Actions workflow will handle this automatically during the build process.
